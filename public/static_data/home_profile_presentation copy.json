      "Between 2017 and 2018, I worked as a project assistant, modeling buildings in SketchUp and AutoCAD. Notably, I generated the exterior image, lobby interior design, and pool area design, along with their renderings in 3ds Max, for the \"Lindo Sol Suites Hotel\" project, and generated the exterior image, floor-plans, Sketchup 3D modeling and Rendering with VRay of the \"Lindo Bakery\".",

      "In 2023, I re-entered the AEC industry as a Revit BIM Technician for VDC Works in Miami, where I discovered visual programming through Revit Dynamo and Python Scripts.",
      
      "Nonetheless, after grappling with Dynamo's limitations for a few months, I discovered RevitAPI programming with .NET and C# and embarked on the journey of developing external commands and scripts for Revit and creating Revit Plugins with WPF.",

      "Later that year, my manager at VDC Works invited me to be the first employee of BIMIQs, a consulting startup for US AEC companies, to work as a BIM modeler, Revit's parametric families designer and modeler, Revit API developer, and Web Fullstack developer. In this role, I coded tools like the Revit Modeler and programmed and hosted the design I received for \"bimiqs.com\".",

      "At BIMIQs, my employer obatiner services of BIM modeling, BIM Research, RevitAPI development and Fullstack Web Development by hiring my multitasking role.",

      "From the last quarter of 2023 to the first of 2024, I worked as a Web Fullstack freelancer and UI & UX designer for \"scalaa.com\", \"theinspiratagroup.com\", \"hotelbelensate.com\", \"eduardoos.com\" (my previous PHP-based site), \"crintt.com\", and my signature landing page website \"thedalessiogroup.com\", where I handled the full hosting, branding, page design, and coding.",

      "Remarkably, during this period, I was introduced to AI integrations for applications, intervening in Andiamo Open AI Requests, Mirar queries to StabilityAI, and developing the WPF Itera Adding and collaborating on the setup of ReplicateAI-based actions.",

      "Avant Leap received services on \"Windows Applications development\", \"API development\", \"RevitAPI External Command\", \"Revit Adding\", \"Revit dynamo Zero Touch Nodes\" and \"AI integration\" from my multitasking role.",
      
      "Currently, I'm developing Fullstack web applications with React and .NET minimal APIs, GitHub CI & CD workflows for AWS EC2 instances, leveraging the DeepSeek AI API, and using SQLite, with the aim of moving towards multiplatform integrations for BIM applications for the AEC Industry.",

      "I'm eager to continue learning and profiling my role to support AEC companies looking for multitasking professionals for AI powered BIM Multiplatform solutions, that seek to hit a sweet spot of result and cost effectiveness in a single person.",
